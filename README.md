# The History of Classic Music

## Milestone project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

A Education Institute has request a website for students on secondary level , to help to introduce them on History of Classical Music.
The purpose of the website is essentially educational with links to wikipedia for those who need further exploration on genres and musical periods.
It offers also the option to fill a form for those with more interest to work on projects related to  Classical music


## UX

The end users of this project are essentially young people in secondary school, ages between 12 to 17. The objective was to create something simple where students could access information and at the same time play a video of one of the most famous opera singers of all time.
The website provides a very easy navigation on mobiles and small,medium and larger screen sizes.

I tried to keep focus on the main idea, which was to provide  a quick view of musical periods and genres in chronological order.

User stories:
While visiting the institute we randomly collected  opinions from youths ages 13 to 17:

1.  As a user, ( 14 years old) I have never heard classical music. I guess there are plenty of them in youtube. It could be great to a youtube view of one of those famous singer to get myself interested on this type of music.
1.  As a user, (16 years old), I don't like history, I want something simple to understand easily musical periods  and genres.
1.  As a user, (17 yeas old), I study violin in my free time, I would like to know if there are more young people  at the school interested to study further  Classical Music History. 



## Technologies Used

1. Vertical Navigation Menu on Mobiles built on Javascript.
1. Responsive Design. There are two grids set, one for mobile view and the rest. It means, Small Medium, Medium and Large use the same grid.
 
 ## Testing
 
 The three  pages  has been tested extensibily on computer  running on Mac or Windows. And also on smart phones.
 Browsers tested :
 * Chrome
 * Safary 
 * Internet Explorer.
 During implementation phases, code has been tested from Chrome with  'Inspect' tool toggling device toolbar on mobile to desktop screen size.

 when testing the application, the main idea was to click on navigation bar. The navigation bar is the same on the three pages and bring back or forward to the website.
 It is not necessary to cling on the arrow in  browser to go back and forth on thewebsite.

* Home
* Timeline
* Contact
* Image on header, links to home.
* Social Links are tested on all pages and in all type of screen sizes and they open in another tab.
* Timeline page. Periods has an anchor link to wikipedia. All of them open in  a new tab.
* Contact page Form. The links are not active - because there is no server collecting inputs-. 


## Deployment

This site is hosted in Github.
I started designing on Balsamiq Wireframe with different options of the same idea.
The one finally designed has been uploaded. Three frames pdf files  with Home, Timeline and Contact.
The idea for the mobile view, was initially to get all the elements vertically located. However finally I opted for a Mobile Navigation Menu  toggling  from close to open listing the 3 links vertically. This was built  using javascript. The idea was picked up from w3schools.com
All coding was programmed in Gitpod workspace and pushed on Github using command 'git push'.
All files are located in /workspace/milestone-project-first:
* index.HTML
* timeline.HTML
* contact.HTML
* README.medium
* mockups folder with:
    * Mockups_Front_End_Develop.pdf
* Assest folder with:
   * css folder: 
        * style.css
   * images folder: 
        *  orchestra.jpg
   * js folder.
        * main.js
