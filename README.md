The end user of this project are scencially persons on secondary school, ages between 12 to 17. The objective was to create something simple where students could access to information and at the same time play a video of one of the most famous opera singer of all time.
The website provide a very easy navigation on mobiles and small,medium and larger screen sizes.

We tried to keep focus on the main idea, which was to provide on a quick view , musical periods and genres in chronological order.

User stories:
While visiting the institute we collect randomly opinion from kids on ages 13 to 17:

1- As a user, ( 14 years old) I have never heard classical music. I guess there are plenty of them in youtube. I guess on the page with a famous one, would point out my attention to deep further.
2- As a user, (16 years old), I don't like history, I want something simple to understand easily times and genres.
3- As a user, (17 yeas old), I study violin on n my free time, I would like to be contacted if there are more children at the school interested to study further on Classical History.
