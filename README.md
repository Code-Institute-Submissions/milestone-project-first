The History of Classic Music

Milestone project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

A Education Institute has request a website for initial students to introduction them on History of Classic Music.

Also, The institution requested as a page to contact us if those students with more interest want to go deep on the investigation.

The final purpose was to facilitate students a quick and easy access to the history of Classic Music.

Demo

UX

The purpose was to reach secondary level students caching up easily  their attention with a youtube  video with a well known Opera singer.
At the same time, providing a easy navigation menu on monitors and mobiles.
However, we tried to keep focus on the main idea, which was to get easily time and genres in chronological order.

User stories:
While visiting the institute we collect randomly opinion from kids on ages 13 to 17:

1- As a user, ( 14 years old) I have never heard classical music. I guess there are plenty of them in youtube. I guess on the page with a famous one, would point out my attention to deep further.
2- As a user, (16 years old), I don't like history, I want something simple to understand easily times and genres.
3- As a user, (17 yeas old), I study violin on n my free time, I would like to be contacted if there are more children at the school interested to study further on Classical History.
